        Python, C#. Learning new technologies and implementing them into life is what inspires me a lot. Love creating things and applications.</p>
    <h2>Morgan Gill</h2>
    <p>Morgan Gill was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Morgan’s mother worked for the Toronto District School Board,
        and Morgan’s father worked in information technology. As the youngest of three brothers, Morgan was accustomed
        to receiving hand-me-downs. Since Morgan’s father worked in I.T. it wasn’t long before many of those hand-me-downs
        started consisting of computer components. At a young age, and with the aid of one of his brothers, Morgan constructed
        his first working computer. Shortly afterwards Morgan’s curiosity pushed him to begin researching the various components
        that made up computers, as he was curious about how they worked. This sparked his interest in computers, information technology,
        and later, programming. Eventually Morgan’s curiosity led to him to George Brown’s Technical Programming Analyst program; and in
        the pursuit of knowledge, he enrolled.</p>
